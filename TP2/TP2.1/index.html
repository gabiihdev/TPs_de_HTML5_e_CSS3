  <h1>Call Out My Name</h1>
  <h2>The Weeknd</h2>
  
  <p> We found each other </br>
  I helped you out of a broken place </br>
  You gave me comfort </br>
  But falling for you was my mistake</p>
  </br>
  
  <p>I put you on top, I put you on top </br>
  I claimed you so proud and openly </br>
  And when times were rough, when times were rough </br>
  I made sure I held you close to me </p>
  </br>
  
  <p>So call out my name (call out my name) </br>
  Call out my name when I kiss you so gently </br>
  I want you to stay (I want you to stay) </br>
  I want you to stay even though you don't want me </br>
  Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?) </br>
  Girl, why can't you wait till I fall out of love? </br>
  Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name) </br>
  Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and </br>
  I'll be on my— </p>
  </br>

  <p>I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied </br>
  I almost cut a piece of myself for your life </br>
  Guess I was just another pit stop </br>
  Till you made up your mind </br>
  You just wasted my time</p>
  </br>

  <p>You're on top, I put you on top </br>
  I claimed you so proud and openly, babe </br>
  And when times were rough, when times were rough </br>
  I made sure I held you close to me</p>
  </br>

  <p>So call out my name (call out my name, baby) </br>
  So call out my name when I kiss you so gently </br>
  I want you to stay (I want you to stay) </br>
  I want you to stay even though you don't want me </br>
  Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait till I—) </br>
  Girl, why can't you wait till I fall out of love? </br>
  Babe, call out my name (say you'll call out my name, baby) </br>
  Just call out my name, and I'll be on my way </br>
  Girl, I'll be on my—</p>
  </br>

  <p>(On my way, on my way) </br> 
  (On my way, on my way, oh) </br>
  (On my way, on my way, on my way) </br>
  (On my way, on my way, on my way) </br>
  (On my—)</p>
